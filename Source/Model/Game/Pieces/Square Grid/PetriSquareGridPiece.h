/*!
 \brief A concrete PetriGridPiece subclass that represents pieces to be placed on a PetriSquareGridBoard.
 
 The coordinate offsets of a PetriSquareGridPiece represent indexes on a board that uses a perpendicular coordinate system. Rotations rotate the piece by 90Â°, so the number of possible orientations is 4.
